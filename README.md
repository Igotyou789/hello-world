     <h4 id="head"</h4>Born in Africa, Elon Musk had a need for two things and two things only, science fiction books and computers. Elon often read up to eight hours on weekends and even went on to create his own science fiction-video game fantasy named “blaster”. Having a set eye on the United States, Elon was sent off to Canada, where Elons family lives, completing many odd jobs such as working in a furnace. Once in the US, Elon and his brother kimbal, started an online money sending business which sold as todays Pay Pal and went on to create Space X that to this day innovates cheap and reusable rockets to sell to different militaries. Next, Elon launches Tesla that uses batteries to power its cars electronically and is now one of the biggest car companies selling over 4.5 million Tesla cars in only 20 years.</h4>

<h5 id="jig"> The Shortest History of Europe </h5>


<h4> This round up of important moments of Europe shows Greek and roman forms of thinking and government. This historical volume gives a great view on conquest, feudalism, and of the many different powers of Europe,   
   including chapters on both world wars and the many different revolutions of Europe which occurred
   during the 18th and 19th centuries.</h4>

<ul>
  <li>     The versaille treaty is the treaty which ended the first world war and which Adolf Hitler broke when provoking the second world war and is also the treaty which formed poland.   </li>


<li>Greek thinking shaped how we think now and how many others thought in the medieval times.  What Greek scholars and philosophers did was that they kept thinking and thinking logical and simple answers and forced these answers out through questions like socrates, aristotle and plato. Aristole also taght Alexander the great which ruled the threatening Macedonia empire from 336 to 323 BCE.   </li>





<li>The Nazi salute dates back to 500BC in the Roman Empire   </li> 


<li>“Augustus was the first emporer of Rome as Rome was democratic and republican and Augustus humbled himself as he was not an emperor at all, but called himself a first citizen”   </li>

 <li> How you pray with your hands folded dates back to someones loyalty to their lord in the mideval times.</li>
